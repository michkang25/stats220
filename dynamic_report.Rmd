## Analyzing Passenger Trends and Bus Punctuality

This report explores key insights from bus trip observations, focusing on three main aspects:

-   **Bus Occupancy**: The number of passengers present at the time of boarding.\
-   **Common Activities**: The most frequent activities observed among passengers.\
-   **Punctuality**: Whether the bus arrived early, on time, or late.
